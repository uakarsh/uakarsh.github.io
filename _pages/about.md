I am an Applied Scientist at **Microsoft's MSAN (Microsoft Audience Network)** team, where I build next-generation machine learning systems for intent-based ad retrieval and monetization. My work spans encoder model development, unified evaluation frameworks, and data quality pipelines — most recently achieving **+14.32 absolute precision points (P@100)** over production baselines while using **30× less training data**, with **+0.61% CTR** and **+0.51% revenue lift** validated in A/B testing.

Before Microsoft, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at **Zomato**, where I built computer vision systems that now evaluate nearly every food image displayed to users across the platform. Prior to that, I was a research intern at **Enterpret**, working on semantic text similarity at scale (1M+ texts).

I hold a **B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Jodhpur** (GPA: 8.43/10.0, 2019–2023).

My research and engineering interests lie at the intersection of **information retrieval**, **representation learning**, and **data quality**. I believe that principled dataset curation is often the highest-leverage intervention in building high-performing ML systems — a theme that runs through my work on ad retrieval, image quality scoring, and document understanding.

I have a publication at **[ICDAR 2024](https://icdar2024.net/)** on generic document pretraining for improved document understanding.
